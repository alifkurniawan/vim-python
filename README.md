# vim-python
Vim configuration file for Pyton IDE

The configuration is based on https://realpython.com/vim-and-python-a-match-made-in-heaven/. Please follow the website instruction to apply the configuration. I made some modifications because some codes are not compatible for python 3. I also use Dracula theme for the UI.
